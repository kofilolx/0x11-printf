from abel mentor
follow the guide
master the variiadic function and function pointers very well

know what to fix and be collaborative
don't copy understand the code if u come by one

use man 3 printf or vi /usr/include/printf.h

to have a grasp
take it one by one

document everything
infact some times the names of variable may be the conflict
and optmise the code
